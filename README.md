## High Level Overview
Every day the script is doing the following:
1. Checking yesterday's picks and storing in database
2. Making picks for tonight's games
3. Tweeting out picks, yesterday's record, and total record

### Pick Algorithm
I did not spend a lot of time developing an algorithm as the purpose of this project was to mess around with deploying a twitter bot.

For each matchup the script is doing the following
1. Group the two teams into one of the following categories: home dog / home favorite / away dog / away favorite
2. Check the percentage of times each team has covered in their given category on that night
3. If a team have covered more than 75% of the time or did not cover less than 25% of the time, the algorithm with tail or fade that team, respectivley
4. If the two teams have contradicting decisions (We want to tail both teams / fade both teams) then no pick will be given for that matchup

## Technologies
- Data is being stored in a sqlite database in the VM
- Script is being scheduled with a cronjob on a Google Cloud VM
- Log files are stored in the filesystem of the VM
